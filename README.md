this rep contains the code and outputs of questions of java lab (lab-1 , part 1 and 2)

questions 

Part1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to implement these input methods in java (command line args,
Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console)


Part2: Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement add, sub, multiplication, div, sqrt, power, mean, variance. Implement a separate Calculator class to include all related function inside that class. (Mean calculation: program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in the process until the user enters the string "end". It then stops input & displays the avg. of numbers)

decription
part1 README
The part1 class provides a menu-driven program that demonstrates various ways to take user input in Java, including:

Command Line Arguments
Scanner
BufferedReader
DataInputStream
Console
Usage Instructions
Running the Program:
Execute the part1 class.
Follow the on-screen menu to choose input methods and input values.
Menu Options:
The menu allows the user to demonstrate different input methods or exit the program.
Input Methods:
The program demonstrates different ways to take user input, such as command line arguments, Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, and Console.
Exiting the Program:
Select the exit option to terminate the program.


CombinedCalculator README
The CombinedCalculator class provides a simple command-line calculator with the following functionalities:

Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Array Operations:
Variance
Standard Deviation
Average



User Interaction:
The user is presented with a menu to choose between different operations.
For basic arithmetic, the user is prompted to enter two numbers, and the result is displayed.
For array operations, the user can input an array, and the program calculates variance, standard deviation, or average based on the user's choice.


Input Handling:
The program utilizes a separate Input method to handle user input, making the code modular and easy to understand.
Input methods are included for entering numbers and arrays.


Error Handling:
The calculator includes appropriate error handling, such as checking for division by zero and handling invalid input.


Usage Instructions
Running the Calculator:
Execute the CombinedCalculator class.
Follow the on-screen menu to choose operations and input values.


Menu Options:
The menu allows the user to perform basic arithmetic or array operations, as well as exit the program.
Arithmetic Operations:
Choose an arithmetic operation, enter two numbers, and view the result.
Array Operations:
Choose an array operation, enter the size and elements of the array, and view the calculated result.
Exiting the Program:
Select the exit option to terminate the program.
