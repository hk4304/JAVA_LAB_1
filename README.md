this rep contains the code and outputs of questions of java lab (lab-1 , part 1 and 2)

questions 

Part1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to implement these input methods in java (command line args,
Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console)


Part2: Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement add, sub, multiplication, div, sqrt, power, mean, variance. Implement a separate Calculator class to include all related function inside that class. (Mean calculation: program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in the process until the user enters the string "end". It then stops input & displays the avg. of numbers)
